Hi there! This is the github page of the [COSMO lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cosmo/). In this repository you can find the software developed by our group, collaborators and friends. 

We put our code here because we believe in open science and want the community to both benefit from our work and contribute to it. 

Clone, enjoy... and cite



## Active Projects

**[i-pi](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/i-pi)** (this is a fork of the [main i-PI repo](https://github.com/i-pi/) containing some experimental features developed in our group):
	 a universal force engine interface written in Python, designed to be used together with an ab-initio, empirical or machine-learning force field (or a combination of these!) to run molecular dynamics simulations, including nuclear quantum effects.

**[chemiscope](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/chemiscope)**:
	a graphical tool for the interactive exploration of materials and molecular databases, as well as a library of re-usable components useful to create new interfaces.	

**[scikit-matter](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/scikit-matter)**:
	a collection of scikit-learn compatible utilities that implement methods born out of the materials science and chemistry communities.

**[librascal](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/librascal)**:
	 a versatile and scalable fingerprint and machine learning code

**[equistore](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/equistore)**:
	a library to handle data storage for atomistic machine learning

**[rascaline](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/rascaline)** (this is a fork of a [repo](https://github.com/Luthaf/rascaline) developed in our group):
	a library to compute representations for atomistic machine learning

**[nice](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/nice)**:
	a set of tools designed for the calculation of invariant and covariant atomic structure representations. 



## Tutorials and Examples:

**[kernel-tutorials](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/kernel-tutorials)**
	a set of utilities and pedagogic notebooks for the use of linear and kernel methods in atomistic modeling

**[sampling-tutorial](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/sampling-tutorial)**
	a set of exercise files and handouts for a sampling tutorial, from thermostatting to non-linear dimensionality reduction



## Legacy code:

We list below a collection of legacy codes and tools developed in our lab. They are functional and working, but no longer maintained. 

**[gle4md](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/gle4md)**
	colored-noise thermostats for molecular dynamics: http://gle4md.org/

**[pamm](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/pamm)**
	tools for the Probabilistic Analysis of Molecular Motifs method

**[sketchmap](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/sketchmap)**
	a suite of programs to perform non-linear dimensionality reduction
