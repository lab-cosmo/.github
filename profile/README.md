Hi there! This is the github page of the [COSMO lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cosmo/).
In this repository you can find the software developed by our group, collaborators and
friends.

We publish our code because we believe in open science and want the community to both
benefit from our work and contribute to it.

Clone, enjoy... and cite

## External Projects

Besides the repositories we pin below we develop the following projects.

**[i-pi](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/i-pi)** a universal force engine designed to be
	 used together with an ab-initio, empirical or machine-learning force field (or a
	 combination of these!) to run molecular dynamics simulations, including nuclear
	 quantum effects.

**[scikit-matter](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/scikit-matter)**: a collection of
	scikit-learn compatible utilities that implement methods born out of the materials
	science and chemistry communities.

**[metatensor](https://github.com/metatensor/metatensor)**: a data storage and exchange format
        created for atomistic machine learning, and a standard interface to load and execute 
	ML models in various simulation engines

**[featomic](https://github.com/metatensor/featomic)**: a library to
	compute representations for atomistic machine learning

## Tutorials and Examples:

**[atomistic-cookbook](https://atomistic-cookbook.org)**
        an online, interactive collection of "recipes" to perform different kinds of 
	atomistic simulations, from path integral dynamics to the training of a ML model

**[kernel-tutorials](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/kernel-tutorials)** a set of utilities
	and pedagogic notebooks for the use of linear and kernel methods in atomistic
	modeling

**[sampling-tutorial](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/sampling-tutorial)** a set of
	exercise files and handouts for a sampling tutorial, from thermostatting to
	non-linear dimensionality reduction

## Legacy code:

We list below a collection of legacy codes and tools developed in our lab. They are
functional and working, but no longer maintained.

**[gle4md](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/gle4md)** colored-noise thermostats for
	molecular dynamics: http://gle4md.org/

**[pamm](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/pamm)** tools for the Probabilistic Analysis of
	Molecular Motifs method

**[sketchmap](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/sketchmap)** a suite of programs to perform
	non-linear dimensionality reduction: http://sketchmap.org
